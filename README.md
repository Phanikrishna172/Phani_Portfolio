-	EDA is done on emergency calls dataset containing 99,492 entries in 9 columns obtained from kaggle using Pandas.
- Missing data regarding the calls in 9, 10 and 11 months is compensated using statistical techniques like linear model plot in Seaborn.
-	The column title which is the description of the call had 110 unique reasons. Upon analysis they are divided into 3 main categories namely EMS, Traffic and Fire with this a new column called Reason is created using apply and lambda function.
-	The number of EMS calls was 48,877 followed by traffic with 35,695 calls and fire with 14,920 calls out of the available data.
-	Visualizations like countplots, heatmap for the number of calls with reason as hue and filtered as per days, months etc., is done using seaborn to analyze the data. For example from the visuals it is understood that the traffic related emergencies was more during weekdays compared to weekends during day time.
